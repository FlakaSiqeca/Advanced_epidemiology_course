Hi everyone,

I wanted to share this edX Harvard University brief online course that I found useful - it is taught by Miguel Hernan himself :)
Here is a link to it: https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+PH559x+1T2019/course/ or just search for "Draw your Assumptions before your Conclusions" in edX courses!

I hope you find it helpful!
Best, 
Flaka.
